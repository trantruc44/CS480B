NOT TO DO LIST:
1.) Forgetting to use Camelcase notation
2.) BAD names for variables due to laziness 

SURPRISING/INTERESTING POINT:
1.) Magic string since I tend to have repetitive code(s) unknowningly. Having a constant variable can help build better programs.
2.) Avoid conditionals: Seems quite impossible and more work to use polymorphism. What if you had 100 different cases?    

DISAGREEMENT:
1.) Don't use Singleton Pattern: In some cases, a program is easier to write since a class will only have one
    instance and provide a global access point. 
2.) Don't leave commented out code in your codebase: sometimes I leave commented out code(s) so I can remember what
    I previously attempted to do
